                Why order with our Baker?
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer" id="answer_1">
                To guarantee that each cake, bread and cookie is hand-made freshly, from scratch, and to order, we carefully choose our network of outstanding bakers. 
                Because of this, when our cakes are delivered to your home, they are still moist and tasty.
                In addition, we can deliver 6 days a week with only a 24-hour notice for the majority of products.
                Most dietary restrictions are met, and our helpful customer support team is always available.

                How do we ensure quality?
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer" id="answer_2">
                Firstly, we only employ bakers who are equipped to operate a baking business. A baker must possess the following in order to be accepted into our community:
                <ol>
                    <li>Food registration approval with their local council</li>
                    <li>The relevant food and hygiene certificate</li>
                    <li>A body of previous work demonstrating their skills as a baker</li>
                </ol>
                Secondly, every baker for every cake we feature is required to meet our strict standards for all of our items. We keep track of every order and ensure that every cake meets our requirements. But as each cake is prepared by hand, there could occasionally be a very slight deviation from the product image.
                Lastly, we consider client comments carefully and monitor baker performance. When we incredibly rarely fall short of customer standards, we instantly try our hardest to make it right.

                Our goal is to give each and every one of our customers wonderful cakes, breads and cookies with excellent service. Senior management evaluates every complaint individually. We strive to settle disputes in a fair and impartial manner, taking into account the worries of both the client and the baker.
                Within 24 hours of receiving the cake, if for any reason you are dissatisfied with your order, kindly write us a feedback with your order number. Any complaint that is made more than 72 hours after the cake is delivered will not be taken into consideration.
                If there is a glaring issue with the cake, we apologize and will try to fix the matter. If we are unable to fix the problem, we shall make a good faith effort to negotiate and agree on the proper discount under the circumstances.
                Additionally, if you like it, you can also send us your feedback.
